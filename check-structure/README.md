## Branching Strategy and Workflow

### Branches Overview

- **main**: Stable production-ready code.
- **develop**: Main development branch for integrating new features and bug fixes.
- **Feature Branches**: For each task, component, or feature, create a new branch from `develop` using the naming pattern `feature/**`, where `**` describes the work being done.

### Creating a Feature Branch

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/feature-description develop
```

### Feature Flags

- Implement a feature flag for each new feature to control its activation.
- Use the feature flag in your code to toggle the feature on or off.

### Component and Design Guidelines for a Modular NestJS Project

- **Modular Components**: Structure the project into modules, each handling a specific domain or feature. This modular approach promotes collaboration by allowing different team members to work on distinct modules independently.
- **Reusable Services**: Develop services that encapsulate business logic and can be reused across multiple modules.
- **Modular Unit Tests**: Ensure that each module has corresponding unit tests for its services, controllers, and other components to verify their behavior.
- **API Integration Tests**: Implement integration tests to validate interactions between different modules and ensure that API endpoints behave as expected.

### Pull Requests

1. Open a pull request (PR) to merge the `feature/**` branch into `develop`.
2. Ensure the PR includes:
   - A clear description of the feature or changes.
   - References to related tasks or tickets.
   - Evidence of testing, including unit and integration tests.
3. Request a code review and address any feedback provided.
4. Ensure all CI/CD checks pass before proceeding with further steps.

### Additional Guidelines

- **Commit Regularly**: Make small, frequent commits to track progress.
- **Stay Updated**: Regularly pull changes from `develop` to keep your feature branch up-to-date.
- **Manage Feature Flags**: Periodically review and clean up unused feature flags.

## Commit Message Guidelines

To ensure consistent and meaningful commit messages, please follow the Conventional Commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- **type**: Describes the kind of change (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).
- **scope**: (Optional) Specifies the section of the codebase affected (e.g., auth, api, ui).
- **subject**: A concise description of the change.

### Examples:

1. **Feature Addition**:
   ```
   feat(api): add new endpoint for user login
   ```
2. **Bug Fix**:
   ```
   fix(auth): resolve issue with JWT token validation
   ```
3. **Documentation Update**:
   ```
   docs(readme): update installation instructions
   ```

Following this format helps in maintaining a clear and structured commit history.

## Guidelines for Effective Commenting

### Module and Service Purpose and Usage

- **What to Comment**: At the start of each module or service file, briefly describe its purpose and role in the backend application.
- **Example**:

```typescript
/**
 * UserService
 * Manages all user-related operations and business logic.
 * Methods:
 * - createUser: Adds a new user to the database.
 * - findUserByEmail: Retrieves a user by email.
 */
```

- **Controller Documentation**: In controller files, document the purpose of each route handler and any specific request/response behavior.
- **Example**:

```typescript
/**
 * UserController
 * Handles incoming requests related to user operations.
 * Endpoints:
 * - POST /users: Create a new user.
 * - GET /users/:id: Retrieve a user by ID.
 */
```

**What to Comment**: At the start of each module or service file, briefly describe the purpose and its role in the application.

- **Example**:

```typescript
/**
 * UserService
 * Handles all user-related operations and business logic.
 * Methods:
 * - createUser: Adds a new user to the database.
 * - findUserByEmail: Retrieves a user by email.
 */
```

### Complex Logic and Calculations

- **What to Comment**: Explain intricate algorithms or calculations to help others understand the logic.
- **Example**:

```typescript
// Calculate the user's age based on their birthdate.
const calculateAge = (birthdate: Date): number => {
  const today = new Date();
  const birthYear = birthdate.getFullYear();
  let age = today.getFullYear() - birthYear;

  if (today.getMonth() < birthdate.getMonth() || 
      (today.getMonth() === birthdate.getMonth() && today.getDate() < birthdate.getDate())) {
    age--;
  }
  return age;
};
```

### Conditional Logic and Edge Cases

- **What to Comment**: Justify the logic behind conditionals, especially for edge cases.
- **Example**:

```typescript
// Check if the user has admin privileges before allowing access to the admin panel.
if (user.isAdmin) {
  // Grant access to the admin panel.
}
```

### API Calls and Data Fetching

- **What to Comment**: Document the purpose of API calls, expected responses, and data utilization.
- **Example**:

```typescript
// Fetch a list of articles from the API and update the state.
async function fetchArticles() {
  try {
    const response = await this.httpService.get('/api/articles').toPromise();
    this.articles = response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching articles:', error);
  }
}
```

### Configuration Files and Environment Variables

- **What to Comment**: Describe the purpose of specific settings in configuration files and the role of environment variables.
- **Example**:

```typescript
// .env
// Base URL for API requests.
API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
```

### General Best Practices

- **Clarity and Conciseness**: Keep comments clear and to the point.
- **Maintainability**: Update comments regularly to match code changes.
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Focus on insights the code doesn’t convey, avoiding obvious statements.

### TODO Comments

- **Best Practices**:
  - Use TODO comments to mark unfinished tasks or areas needing improvement.
  - Provide sufficient context within the TODO to clarify the task’s purpose and next steps.
  - Include backend-specific tasks such as pending service methods or database schema updates.

````typescript
// TODO: Implement caching for this API response to improve performance.
// TODO: Update database schema to include the new 'lastLogin' field in the 'users' table.
// TODO: Refactor authentication service to include OAuth2.0 support.
``` Practices**:
  - Use TODO comments to mark unfinished tasks or areas needing improvement.
  - Provide sufficient context within the TODO to clarify the task’s purpose and next steps.

```typescript
// TODO: Implement caching for this API response to improve performance.
````

Unit Testing with Jest

&#x9;•	Use Jest to test individual services and components.

&#x9;•	Mock external dependencies to isolate tests.



E2E Testing with Supertest

&#x9;•	Use Supertest to test HTTP endpoints by sending requests and verifying responses.



Running Tests

&#x9;•	Run all tests using the test script defined in package.json.

&#x9;•	You can also run specific tests by specifying the test file.
